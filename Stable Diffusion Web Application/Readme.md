# Introduction 
Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model that has been trained to generate images based on text prompts. In this article, we will explore how to build a web application that leverages this model to allow users to generate images with ease. 
The application will be built using FastAPI and React, two popular and powerful technologies for building web applications. FastAPI will be used to build the backend, which will handle the communication between the client and the model, while React will be used to build the front end, which will allow users to interact with the application. This article will provide an overview of how to build this application from scratch, including the design and implementation of the backend and front end. 
Whether you are a seasoned web developer or a beginner looking to learn about these technologies, this article will provide valuable insights and practical knowledge that you can use to build your own Stable Diffusion-Based Image Generation Web Application.
